## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application uses a monorepo structure with clear separation between client and server code:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, built with Vite
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript 
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React Context for auth
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **File Processing**: Sharp for image manipulation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Structure**: Uses shadcn/ui component library for consistent UI
- **Routing**: wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: 
  - TanStack Query for server state and caching
  - React Context for authentication state
  - Local component state for UI interactions
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming
- **File Handling**: Custom upload components with drag-and-drop support

### Backend Architecture
- **API Structure**: RESTful API with Express.js
- **Authentication Middleware**: JWT token verification
- **File Upload**: Multer middleware for handling multipart/form-data
- **Image Processing**: Sharp library for image transformations
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with type-safe queries

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Stores user credentials, pro status, and subscription info
- **Processing Logs Table**: Tracks user activity and usage analytics
- **Relations**: One-to-many relationship between users and processing logs

### Authentication System
- **Registration/Login**: Email-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- **JWT Tokens**: Stored in localStorage, sent via Authorization header
- **Protected Routes**: Middleware validates tokens for authenticated endpoints
- **User Tiers**: Free vs Pro users with different feature access

## Data Flow

1. **User Registration/Login**: Client sends credentials ‚Üí Server validates ‚Üí JWT token returned
2. **File Upload**: Client uploads file ‚Üí Server validates file type/size ‚Üí Processing pipeline
3. **Image Processing**: File processed with Sharp ‚Üí Result cached/stored ‚Üí Download URL returned
4. **Usage Tracking**: Processing events logged to database for analytics
5. **Premium Features**: Pro status checked before allowing advanced operations

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL database connection (Neon serverless)
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database ORM
- **sharp**: High-performance image processing
- **bcrypt**: Password hashing
- **jsonwebtoken**: JWT authentication

- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for Node.js
- **drizzle-kit**: Database migrations and schema management

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment with:

- **Build Process**: 
  - Frontend built with Vite to `dist/public`
  - Backend built with esbuild to `dist/index.js`
- **Environment Variables**: 
  - `DATABASE_URL` for PostgreSQL connection
  - `JWT_SECRET` for token signing
  - `NODE_ENV` for environment detection
- **Database**: Uses Neon serverless PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Static Assets**: Frontend served from backend in production
- **Development**: Vite dev server proxied through Express

### Key Features
- **Image Tools**: Resize, convert (PNG‚ÜîJPG, WebP, HEIC), compress, crop
- **User Management**: Registration, login, pro subscriptions
- **Usage Analytics**: Processing logs and dashboard statistics
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **Ad Integration**: Placeholder for Google AdSense (free users only)
- **File Validation**: Type and size restrictions based on user tier

The architecture prioritizes type safety, performance, and user experience while maintaining clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend systems.
